# **App Name**: Lexora Drafts

## Core Features:

- Smart Legal Draft Generation: Generate formatted legal drafts (PDF/Word) based on user-provided document type and input fields. The LLM is a tool here.
- Auto-Formatting & Section Explanation: Annotate each document section with clear, simple explanations.
- Law & Case Updates Feed: Display a real-time feed of latest Indian legal updates, case summaries, and rulings from Firestore.
- Quick Templates Library: Provide pre-filled, editable templates for common legal forms, sourced from Firestore.
- Legal Glossary Panel: Integrate a searchable glossary explaining common legal terms.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#6C63FF), reflecting the app's association with both the legal profession and cutting edge technology. It evokes a sense of trust.
- Background color: Desaturated deep purple (#22213F). The hue is closely aligned to the primary color, and its dark value reinforces a dark scheme.
- Accent color: Light purple (#D1C9FF), used for text surfaces, highlights, and interactive elements, provides clear contrast against the dark background.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', sans-serif. Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif. Poppins is for headlines because it has a geometric, fashionable look that enhances the avant-garde aesthetic of the brand. Inter, with its machined, neutral look, is suited to rendering long lines of body text in a readable way.
- Lucide-React/Feather icons are to be used for a consistent and clean interface.
- Left workspace for document generation, right sidebar for law updates, and a fixed footer for key action buttons ('Generate', 'Download', 'Reset').
- Use subtle animations to highlight changes and guide the user through the generation process, employing Framer Motion.
