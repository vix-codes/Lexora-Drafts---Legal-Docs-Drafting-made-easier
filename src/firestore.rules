/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Lexora Drafts application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user authentication and data access control.
 * - Server actions (like creating a verification request) are permitted.
 * - Authenticated users can only read their own data.
 * - A designated lawyer has special privileges to review all verification requests.
 * - Public collections (templates, feed, glossary) are read-only for everyone.
