/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Lexora Drafts application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user authentication and data access control for user profiles,
 * while allowing public read access to legal templates,
 * law feed updates, and the legal glossary.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the authenticated user.
 * - /users/{userId}/activities/{activityId}: Stores activity logs, accessible only to the owner.
 * - /templates/{templateId}: Stores legal templates, publicly readable.
 * - /lawFeed/{updateId}: Stores law feed updates, publicly readable.
 * - /glossary/{termId}: Stores legal terms and definitions, publicly readable.
 * - /verificationRequests/{requestId}: Stores draft verification requests.
 * - /lawyers/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles.
